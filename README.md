# global-python-cleaner
Despite being an experienced developer, I still make mistakes. I mistakenly install requirements.txt on global python
of my pc. This is to clean any such installation/s.

## Usage
```bash 
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sadaqatullah/global-python-cleaner/main/cleanup_packages.py | python3 -
