# Python Environment Cleaner üßπ

Despite being an experienced developer, we all make mistakes. This script is designed to help clean up Python environments by uninstalling all packages that are not part of the standard library, keeping your global and virtual environments clean.

## üö´ Common Mistakes This Tool Addresses

- Mistakenly installing packages in the global environment
- Installing packages in the wrong virtual environment
- Installing packages for the wrong version of Python
- Creating a virtualenv in the wrong directory, affecting other projects

## üöÄ Usage

### Method 1: Auto-Uninstall All Non-Essential Packages

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sadaqatullah/global-python-cleaner/refs/heads/master/cleaner.py | sed 's/input("Do you want to proceed? (y\/n): ").lower()/"\&\#x79;"/' | python3 - --auto-confirm
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This will delete every package except pyenv, pip, wheel, virtualenv, and setuptools.

### Method 2: Auto-Uninstall with Custom Package Retention

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sadaqatullah/global-python-cleaner/refs/heads/master/cleaner.py | sed 's/input("Do you want to proceed? (y\/n): ").lower()/"\&\#x79;"/' | python3 - --auto-confirm --keep <space-separated-package-names>
```

#### Example: Keeping Django and Essential Packages

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sadaqatullah/global-python-cleaner/refs/heads/master/cleaner.py | sed 's/input("Do you want to proceed? (y\/n): ").lower()/"\&\#x79;"/' | python3 - --auto-confirm --keep django
```

Output:
```
The following packages will be kept:
  - setuptools

  - pyenv
  - wheel
  - pip
  - virtualenv
The following packages will be uninstalled:
    - package-1
